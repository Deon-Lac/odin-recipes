        cream. It's unbelievably good!</p>

    <!--Ingedient List-->
    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <h3>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make my famous spaghetti:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong>
            An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings. </li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong>
            You’ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti sauce:</strong>
            Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>
            Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream:
            </strong>
            A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti
            sauce.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong>
            Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti. 
        </li>
